## AKRK's Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp junk

* [Flower Breeding Simulator](https://akrk-acpc.github.io/flower_breeding_simulator/index.html)
  - This is to figure out the fastest way of cross-pollinating flowers to reach a desired goal.
  - Typically that desired goal will be "145ish of every color so I can buy out Lloid and complete my catalog"
* [Desired Quarry Reward Chances](https://akrk-acpc.github.io/quarry/index.html)
  - "Should I settle for this non-sparkly essence?"
  - Shows the odds of you getting your desired quarry rewards within however many cycles you have left. 
* [What's your True Level? True Level Calculator](https://akrk-acpc.github.io/true_level/index.html)
  - Shows how far away you are from max Player Level, in terms of "Total Villager Friend Points/EXP".
  - At level 51, you could *technically* be anywhere from 22% to 49% of the way to level 79. Quite a spread!
